## üåê Networking Projects Using Trees

These projects explore how tree data structures can be applied in computer networks ‚Äî for routing, bandwidth optimization, and more.

---

### 1. **Routing Table Simulator using Trie**
- Implement a routing table that uses **Longest Prefix Match (LPM)** via a Trie.
- Input: IP addresses in CIDR format (e.g., 192.168.0.0/16)
- Use Trie for efficient IP lookup and matching.
- üîß Tools: Python, Flask or CLI

---

### 2. **Multicast Routing Tree Simulator**
- Build a simulator for **multicast trees** (like shortest-path trees or spanning trees).
- Visualize multicast routing from a source to multiple destinations.
- Explore **Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm**, **Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF)**.
- üîß Tools: JavaScript + D3.js, Python + Graphviz

---

### 3. **Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Visualizer**
- Simulate how switches in a network use **STP** to prevent loops.
- Animate election of root bridge and blocking/non-blocking ports.
- üîß Tools: React + SVG or Python + Tkinter

---

### 4. **Domain Name System (DNS) Tree Resolver**
- Build a recursive tree-based DNS resolver.
- Mimic how the DNS hierarchy works: Root ‚Üí TLD ‚Üí Domain ‚Üí Subdomain.
- üîß Tools: Python or JavaScript, sockets for actual resolution

---

### 5. **Hierarchical Network Topology Builder**
- Design and simulate 2-tier or 3-tier network topologies (Core, Distribution, Access layers).
- Use a **tree structure** to represent switch and router hierarchy.
- Allow configuration of bandwidth and latency.
- üîß Tools: React, Graphviz, or network emulators like Cisco Packet Tracer

---

### 6. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Tree-Based Overlay Network**
- Build a structured overlay network (like a multicast tree or binary tree) for peer communication.
- Nodes join/leave the tree, and messages are routed efficiently.
- üîß Tools: Python (asyncio), WebSockets

---

### 7. **Bandwidth-Aware Tree Construction**
- Implement algorithms that build multicast trees based on **bandwidth availability**.
- Use max-flow/min-cut or greedy techniques to optimize the tree.
